# Notes from 260
## Markdown notes
  I learned about the following
  + how to make lists
  + how to indent
  + that you can make links to other pages like **[my readMe page](/README.md)**
  + [MarkDown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#relative-links)
  + To ssh into my server I do this `ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]` and to exit I `exit`
